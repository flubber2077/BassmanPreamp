# Pan-O-Flex

[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/C0C5AYNGR)
 
Emulation of the Versatone Pan-O-Flex. Known for use by Carol Kaye during many LA sessions including Pet Sounds, and Jack Cassady of Jefferson Airplane.

So far the first triode pair is fully implemented, along with a simple room reverb algorithm and master volume.


Dropping this here, makes me feel no need to simulate tubes accurately to get good results. http://dafx10.iem.at/proceedings/papers/MacakSchimmel_DAFx10_P12.pdf
